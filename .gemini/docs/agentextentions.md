# Gemini CLI extensions

source: https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions/

Gemini CLI extensions package prompts, MCP servers, custom commands, themes,
hooks, sub-agents, and agent skills into a familiar and user-friendly format.
With extensions, you can expand the capabilities of Gemini CLI and share those
capabilities with others. They are designed to be easily installable and
shareable.

# Build Gemini CLI extensions

Gemini CLI extensions let you expand the capabilities of Gemini CLI by adding
custom tools, commands, and context. This guide walks you through creating your
first extension, from setting up a template to adding custom functionality and
linking it for local development.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have Gemini CLI installed and a basic understanding
of Node.js.

## Extension features

Extensions offer several ways to customize Gemini CLI. Use this table to decide
which features your extension needs.

| Feature                                                        | What it is                                                                                                                | When to use it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Invoked by            |

| **[MCP server](/docs/extensions/reference#mcp-servers)**                     | A standard way to expose new tools and data sources to the model.                                                         | Use this when you want the model to be able to _do_ new things, like fetching data from an internal API, querying a database, or controlling a local application. We also support MCP resources (which can replace custom commands) and system instructions (which can replace custom context) | Model                 |
| **[Custom commands](/docs/cli/custom-commands)**               | A shortcut (like `/my-cmd`) that executes a pre-defined prompt or shell command.                                          | Use this for repetitive tasks or to save long, complex prompts that you use frequently. Great for automation.                                                                                                                                                                                  | User                  |
| **[Context file (`GEMINI.md`)](/docs/extensions/reference#contextfilename)** | A markdown file containing instructions that are loaded into the model's context at the start of every session.           | Use this to define the "personality" of your extension, set coding standards, or provide essential knowledge that the model should always have.                                                                                                                                                | CLI provides to model |
| **[Agent skills](/docs/cli/skills)**                           | A specialized set of instructions and workflows that the model activates only when needed.                                | Use this for complex, occasional tasks (like "create a PR" or "audit security") to avoid cluttering the main context window when the skill isn't being used.                                                                                                                                   | Model                 |
| **[Hooks](/docs/hooks)**                                 | A way to intercept and customize the CLI's behavior at specific lifecycle events (for example, before/after a tool call). | Use this when you want to automate actions based on what the model is doing, like validating tool arguments, logging activity, or modifying the model's input/output.                                                                                                                          | CLI                   |
| **[Custom themes](/docs/extensions/reference#themes)**                       | A set of color definitions to personalize the CLI UI.                                                                     | Use this to provide a unique visual identity for your extension or to offer specialized high-contrast or thematic color schemes.                                                                                                                                                               | User (via /theme)     |

## Step 1: Create a new extension

The easiest way to start is by using a built-in template. We'll use the
`mcp-server` example as our foundation.

Run the following command to create a new directory called `my-first-extension`
with the template files:

```bash
gemini extensions new my-first-extension mcp-server
```

This creates a directory with the following structure:

```
my-first-extension/
├── example.js
├── gemini-extension.json
└── package.json
```

## Step 2: Understand the extension files

Your new extension contains several key files that define its behavior.

### `gemini-extension.json`

The manifest file tells Gemini CLI how to load and use your extension.

```json
{
  "name": "mcp-server-example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "mcpServers": {
    "nodeServer": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${extensionPath}${/}example.js"],
      "cwd": "${extensionPath}"
    }
  }
}
```

- `name`: The unique name for your extension.
- `version`: The version of your extension.
- `mcpServers`: Defines Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to add new tools.
  - `command`, `args`, `cwd`: Specify how to start your server. The
    `${extensionPath}` variable is replaced with the absolute path to your
    extension's directory.

### `example.js`

This file contains the source code for your MCP server. It uses the
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to define tools.

```javascript
/**
 * @license
 * Copyright 2025 Google LLC
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 */

import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js';
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';
import { z } from 'zod';

const server = new McpServer({
  name: 'prompt-server',
  version: '1.0.0',
});

// Registers a new tool named 'fetch_posts'
server.registerTool(
  'fetch_posts',
  {
    description: 'Fetches a list of posts from a public API.',
    inputSchema: z.object({}).shape,
  },
  async () => {
    const apiResponse = await fetch(
      'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',
    );
    const posts = await apiResponse.json();
    const response = { posts: posts.slice(0, 5) };
    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: JSON.stringify(response),
        },
      ],
    };
  },
);

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### `package.json`

The standard configuration file for a Node.js project. It defines dependencies
and scripts for your extension.

## Step 3: Add extension settings

Some extensions need configuration, such as API keys or user preferences. Let's
add a setting for an API key.

1.  Open `gemini-extension.json`.
2.  Add a `settings` array to the configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "mcp-server-example",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "settings": [
        {
          "name": "API Key",
          "description": "The API key for the service.",
          "envVar": "MY_SERVICE_API_KEY",
          "sensitive": true
        }
      ],
      "mcpServers": {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

When a user installs this extension, Gemini CLI will prompt them to enter the
"API Key". The value will be stored securely in the system keychain (because
`sensitive` is true) and injected into the MCP server's process as the
`MY_SERVICE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Step 4: Link your extension

Link your extension to your Gemini CLI installation for local development.

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd my-first-extension
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Link the extension:**

    The `link` command creates a symbolic link from Gemini CLI extensions
    directory to your development directory. Changes you make are reflected
    immediately.

    ```bash
    gemini extensions link .
    ```

Restart your Gemini CLI session to use the new `fetch_posts` tool. Test it by
asking: "fetch posts".

## Step 5: Add a custom command

Custom commands create shortcuts for complex prompts.

1.  Create a `commands` directory and a subdirectory for your command group:

    **macOS/Linux**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p commands/fs
    ```

    **Windows (PowerShell)**

    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "commands\fs"
    ```

2.  Create a file named `commands/fs/grep-code.toml`:

    ```toml
    prompt = """
    Please summarize the findings for the pattern `{{args}}`.

    Search Results:
    !{grep -r {{args}} .}
    """
    ```

    This command, `/fs:grep-code`, takes an argument, runs the `grep` shell
    command, and pipes the results into a prompt for summarization.

After saving the file, restart Gemini CLI. Run `/fs:grep-code "some pattern"` to
use your new command.

## Step 6: Add a custom `GEMINI.md`

Provide persistent context to the model by adding a `GEMINI.md` file to your
extension. This is useful for setting behavior or providing essential tool
information.

1.  Create a file named `GEMINI.md` in the root of your extension directory:

    ```markdown
    # My First Extension Instructions

    You are an expert developer assistant. When the user asks you to fetch
    posts, use the `fetch_posts` tool. Be concise in your responses.
    ```

2.  Update your `gemini-extension.json` to load this file:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-first-extension",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "contextFileName": "GEMINI.md",
      "mcpServers": {
        "nodeServer": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["${extensionPath}${/}example.js"],
          "cwd": "${extensionPath}"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Restart Gemini CLI. The model now has the context from your `GEMINI.md` file in
every session where the extension is active.

## (Optional) Step 7: Add an Agent Skill

[Agent Skills](/docs/cli/skills) bundle specialized expertise and workflows.
Skills are activated only when needed, which saves context tokens.

1.  Create a `skills` directory and a subdirectory for your skill:

    **macOS/Linux**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p skills/security-audit
    ```

    **Windows (PowerShell)**

    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "skills\security-audit"
    ```

2.  Create a `skills/security-audit/SKILL.md` file:

    ```markdown
    ---
    name: security-audit
    description:
      Expertise in auditing code for security vulnerabilities. Use when the user
      asks to "check for security issues" or "audit" their changes.
    ---

    # Security Auditor

    You are an expert security researcher. When auditing code:

    1. Look for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
    2. Check for hardcoded secrets or API keys.
    3. Suggest remediation steps for any findings.
    ```

Gemini CLI automatically discovers skills bundled with your extension. The model
activates them when it identifies a relevant task.

## Step 8: Release your extension

When your extension is ready, share it with others via a Git repository or
GitHub Releases. Refer to the [Extension Releasing Guide](/docs/extensions/releasing) for
detailed instructions and learn how to list your extension in the gallery.

# Gemini CLI extension best practices

This guide covers best practices for developing, securing, and maintaining
Gemini CLI extensions.

## Development

Developing extensions for Gemini CLI is a lightweight, iterative process. Use
these strategies to build robust and efficient extensions.

### Structure your extension

While simple extensions may contain only a few files, we recommend a organized
structure for complex projects.

```text
my-extension/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── gemini-extension.json
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── tools/
└── dist/
```

- **Use TypeScript:** We strongly recommend using TypeScript for type safety and
  improved developer experience.
- **Separate source and build:** Keep your source code in `src/` and output
  build artifacts to `dist/`.
- **Bundle dependencies:** If your extension has many dependencies, bundle them
  using a tool like `esbuild` to reduce installation time and avoid conflicts.

### Iterate with `link`

Use the `gemini extensions link` command to develop locally without reinstalling
your extension after every change.

```bash
cd my-extension
gemini extensions link .
```

Changes to your code are immediately available in the CLI after you rebuild the
project and restart the session.

### Use `GEMINI.md` effectively

Your `GEMINI.md` file provides essential context to the model.

- **Focus on goals:** Explain the high-level purpose of the extension and how to
  interact with its tools.
- **Be concise:** Avoid dumping exhaustive documentation into the file. Use
  clear, direct language.
- **Provide examples:** Include brief examples of how the model should use
  specific tools or commands.

## Security

Follow the principle of least privilege and rigorous input validation when
building extensions.

### Minimal permissions

Only request the permissions your MCP server needs to function. Avoid giving the
model broad access (such as full shell access) if restricted tools are
sufficient.

If your extension uses powerful tools like `run_shell_command`, restrict them in
your `gemini-extension.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-safe-extension",
  "excludeTools": ["run_shell_command(rm -rf *)"]
}
```

This ensures the CLI blocks dangerous commands even if the model attempts to
execute them.

### Validate inputs

Your MCP server runs on the user's machine. Always validate tool inputs to
prevent arbitrary code execution or unauthorized filesystem access.

```typescript
// Example: Validating paths
if (!path.resolve(inputPath).startsWith(path.resolve(allowedDir) + path.sep)) {
  throw new Error('Access denied');
}
```

### Secure sensitive settings

If your extension requires API keys or other secrets, use the `sensitive: true`
option in your manifest. This ensures keys are stored in the system keychain and
obfuscated in the CLI output.

```json
"settings": [
  {
    "name": "API Key",
    "envVar": "MY_API_KEY",
    "sensitive": true
  }
]
```

## Release

Follow standard versioning and release practices to ensure a smooth experience
for your users.

### Semantic versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) to communicate
changes clearly.

- **Major:** Breaking changes (for example, renaming tools or changing
  arguments).
- **Minor:** New features (for example, adding new tools or commands).
- **Patch:** Bug fixes and performance improvements.

### Release channels

Use Git branches to manage release channels. This lets users choose between
stability and the latest features.

```bash
# Install the stable version (default branch)
gemini extensions install github.com/user/repo

# Install the development version
gemini extensions install github.com/user/repo --ref dev
```

### Clean artifacts

When using GitHub Releases, ensure your archives only contain necessary files
(such as `dist/`, `gemini-extension.json`, and `package.json`). Exclude
`node_modules/` and `src/` to minimize download size.

## Test and verify

Test your extension thoroughly before releasing it to users.

- **Manual verification:** Use `gemini extensions link` to test your extension
  in a live CLI session. Verify that tools appear in the debug console (F12) and
  that custom commands resolve correctly.
- **Automated testing:** If your extension includes an MCP server, write unit
  tests for your tool logic using a framework like Vitest or Jest. You can test
  MCP tools in isolation by mocking the transport layer.

## Troubleshooting

Use these tips to diagnose and fix common extension issues.

### Extension not loading

If your extension doesn't appear in `/extensions list`:

- **Check the manifest:** Ensure `gemini-extension.json` is in the root
  directory and contains valid JSON.
- **Verify the name:** The `name` field in the manifest must match the extension
  directory name exactly.
- **Restart the CLI:** Extensions are loaded at the start of a session. Restart
  Gemini CLI after making changes to the manifest or linking a new extension.

### MCP server failures

If your tools aren't working as expected:

- **Check the logs:** View the CLI logs to see if the MCP server failed to
  start.
- **Test the command:** Run the server's `command` and `args` directly in your
  terminal to ensure it starts correctly outside of Gemini CLI.
- **Debug console:** In interactive mode, press **F12** to open the debug
  console and inspect tool calls and responses.

### Command conflicts

If a custom command isn't responding:

- **Check precedence:** Remember that user and project commands take precedence
  over extension commands. Use the prefixed name (for example,
  `/extension.command`) to verify the extension's version.
- **Help command:** Run `/help` to see a list of all available commands and
  their sources.

# Release extensions

Release Gemini CLI extensions to your users through a Git repository or GitHub
Releases.

Git repository releases are the simplest approach and offer the most flexibility
for managing development branches. GitHub Releases are more efficient for
initial installations because they ship as single archives rather than requiring
a full `git clone`. Use GitHub Releases if you need to include platform-specific
binary files.

## List your extension in the gallery

The [Gemini CLI extension gallery](https://geminicli.com/extensions/browse/)
automatically indexes public extensions to help users discover your work. You
don't need to submit an issue or email us to list your extension.

To have your extension automatically discovered and listed:

1.  **Use a public repository:** Ensure your extension is hosted in a public
    GitHub repository.
2.  **Add the GitHub topic:** Add the `gemini-cli-extension` topic to your
    repository's **About** section. Our crawler uses this topic to find new
    extensions.
3.  **Place the manifest at the root:** Ensure your `gemini-extension.json` file
    is in the absolute root of the repository or the release archive.

Our system crawls tagged repositories daily. Once you tag your repository, your
extension will appear in the gallery if it passes validation.

## Release through a Git repository

Releasing through Git is the most flexible option. Create a public Git
repository and provide the URL to your users. They can then install your
extension using `gemini extensions install <your-repo-uri>`.

Users can optionally depend on a specific branch, tag, or commit using the
`--ref` argument. For example:

```bash
gemini extensions install <your-repo-uri> --ref=stable
```

Whenever you push commits to the referenced branch, the CLI prompts users to
update their installation. The `HEAD` commit is always treated as the latest
version.

### Manage release channels

You can use branches or tags to manage different release channels, such as
`stable`, `preview`, or `dev`.

We recommend using your default branch as the stable release channel. This
ensures that the default installation command always provides the most reliable
version of your extension. You can then use a `dev` branch for active
development and merge it into the default branch when you are ready for a
release.

## Release through GitHub Releases

Distributing extensions through
[GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)
provides a faster installation experience by avoiding a repository clone.

Gemini CLI checks for updates by looking for the **Latest** release on GitHub.
Users can also install specific versions using the `--ref` argument with a
release tag. Use the `--pre-release` flag to install the latest version even if
it isn't marked as **Latest**.

### Custom pre-built archives

You can attach custom archives directly to your GitHub Release as assets. This
is useful if your extension requires a build step or includes platform-specific
binaries.

Custom archives must be fully self-contained and follow the required
[archive structure](#archive-structure). If your extension is
platform-independent, provide a single generic asset.

#### Platform-specific archives

To let Gemini CLI find the correct asset for a user's platform, use the
following naming convention:

1.  **Platform and architecture-specific:**
    `{platform}.{arch}.{name}.{extension}`
2.  **Platform-specific:** `{platform}.{name}.{extension}`
3.  **Generic:** A single asset will be used as a fallback if no specific match
    is found.

Use these values for the placeholders:

- `{name}`: Your extension name.
- `{platform}`: Use `darwin` (macOS), `linux`, or `win32` (Windows).
- `{arch}`: Use `x64` or `arm64`.
- `{extension}`: Use `.tar.gz` or `.zip`.

**Examples:**

- `darwin.arm64.my-tool.tar.gz` (specific to Apple Silicon Macs)
- `darwin.my-tool.tar.gz` (fallback for all Macs, for example Intel)
- `linux.x64.my-tool.tar.gz`
- `win32.my-tool.zip`

#### Archive structure

Archives must be fully contained extensions. The `gemini-extension.json` file
must be at the root of the archive. The rest of the layout should match a
standard extension structure.

#### Example GitHub Actions workflow

Use this example workflow to build and release your extension for multiple
platforms:

```yaml
name: Release Extension

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build extension
        run: npm run build

      - name: Create release assets
        run: |

## Migrating an Extension Repository

If you need to move your extension to a new repository (for example, from a
personal account to an organization) or rename it, you can use the `migratedTo`
property in your `gemini-extension.json` file to seamlessly transition your
users.

1. **Create the new repository**: Setup your extension in its new location.
2. **Update the old repository**: In your original repository, update the
   `gemini-extension.json` file to include the `migratedTo` property, pointing
   to the new repository URL, and bump the version number. You can optionally
   change the `name` of your extension at this time in the new repository.
   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-extension",
     "version": "1.1.0",
     "migratedTo": "https://github.com/new-owner/new-extension-repo"
   }
   ```
3. **Release the update**: Publish this new version in your old repository.

When users check for updates, Gemini CLI will detect the `migratedTo` field,
verify that the new repository contains a valid extension update, and
automatically update their local installation to track the new source and name
moving forward. All extension settings will automatically migrate to the new
installation.

# Extension reference

This guide covers the `gemini extensions` commands and the structure of the
`gemini-extension.json` configuration file.

## Manage extensions

Use the `gemini extensions` command group to manage your extensions from the
terminal.

Note that commands like `gemini extensions install` are not supported within the
CLI's interactive mode. However, you can use the `/extensions list` command to
view installed extensions. All management operations, including updates to slash
commands, take effect only after you restart the CLI session.

### Install an extension

Install an extension by providing its GitHub repository URL or a local file
path.

Gemini CLI creates a copy of the extension during installation. You must run
`gemini extensions update` to pull changes from the source. To install from
GitHub, you must have `git` installed on your machine.

```bash
gemini extensions install <source> [--ref <ref>] [--auto-update] [--pre-release] [--consent] [--skip-settings]
```

- `<source>`: The GitHub URL or local path of the extension.
- `--ref`: The git ref (branch, tag, or commit) to install.
- `--auto-update`: Enable automatic updates for this extension.
- `--pre-release`: Enable installation of pre-release versions.
- `--consent`: Acknowledge security risks and skip the confirmation prompt.
- `--skip-settings`: Skip the configuration on install process.

### Uninstall an extension

To uninstall one or more extensions, use the `uninstall` command:

```bash
gemini extensions uninstall <name...>
```

### Disable an extension

Extensions are enabled globally by default. You can disable an extension
entirely or for a specific workspace.

```bash
gemini extensions disable <name> [--scope <scope>]
```

- `<name>`: The name of the extension to disable.
- `--scope`: The scope to disable the extension in (`user` or `workspace`).

### Enable an extension

Re-enable a disabled extension using the `enable` command:

```bash
gemini extensions enable <name> [--scope <scope>]
```

- `<name>`: The name of the extension to enable.
- `--scope`: The scope to enable the extension in (`user` or `workspace`).

### Update an extension

Update an extension to the version specified in its `gemini-extension.json`
file.

```bash
gemini extensions update <name>
```

To update all installed extensions at once:

```bash
gemini extensions update --all
```

### Create an extension from a template

Create a new extension directory using a built-in template.

```bash
gemini extensions new <path> [template]
```

- `<path>`: The directory to create.
- `[template]`: The template to use (for example, `mcp-server`, `context`,
  `custom-commands`).

### Link a local extension

Create a symbolic link between your development directory and Gemini CLI
extensions directory. This lets you test changes immediately without
reinstalling.

```bash
gemini extensions link <path>
```

## Extension format

Gemini CLI loads extensions from `<home>/.gemini/extensions`. Each extension
must have a `gemini-extension.json` file in its root directory.

### `gemini-extension.json`

The manifest file defines the extension's behavior and configuration.

```json
{
  "name": "my-extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My awesome extension",
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${extensionPath}/my-server.js"],
      "cwd": "${extensionPath}"
    }
  },
  "contextFileName": "GEMINI.md",
  "excludeTools": ["run_shell_command"],
  "migratedTo": "https://github.com/new-owner/new-extension-repo",
  "plan": {
    "directory": ".gemini/plans"
  }
}
```

- `name`: The name of the extension. This is used to uniquely identify the
  extension and for conflict resolution when extension commands have the same
  name as user or project commands. The name should be lowercase or numbers and
  use dashes instead of underscores or spaces. This is how users will refer to
  your extension in the CLI. Note that we expect this name to match the
  extension directory name.
- `version`: The version of the extension.
- `description`: A short description of the extension. This will be displayed on
  [geminicli.com/extensions](https://geminicli.com/extensions).
- `migratedTo`: The URL of the new repository source for the extension. If this
  is set, the CLI will automatically check this new source for updates and
  migrate the extension's installation to the new source if an update is found.
- `mcpServers`: A map of MCP servers to settings. The key is the name of the
  server, and the value is the server configuration. These servers will be
  loaded on startup just like MCP servers defined in a
  [`settings.json` file](/docs/reference/configuration). If both an extension
  and a `settings.json` file define an MCP server with the same name, the server
  defined in the `settings.json` file takes precedence.
  - Note that all MCP server configuration options are supported except for
    `trust`.
  - For portability, you should use `${extensionPath}` to refer to files within
    your extension directory.
  - Separate your executable and its arguments using `command` and `args`
    instead of putting them both in `command`.
- `contextFileName`: The name of the file that contains the context for the
  extension. This will be used to load the context from the extension directory.
  If this property is not used but a `GEMINI.md` file is present in your
  extension directory, then that file will be loaded.
- `excludeTools`: An array of tool names to exclude from the model. You can also
  specify command-specific restrictions for tools that support it, like the
  `run_shell_command` tool. For example,
  `"excludeTools": ["run_shell_command(rm -rf)"]` will block the `rm -rf`
  command. Note that this differs from the MCP server `excludeTools`
  functionality, which can be listed in the MCP server config.
- `plan`: Planning features configuration.
  - `directory`: The directory where planning artifacts are stored. This serves
    as a fallback if the user hasn't specified a plan directory in their
    settings. If not specified by either the extension or the user, the default
    is `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/<session-id>/plans/`.

When Gemini CLI starts, it loads all the extensions and merges their
configurations. If there are any conflicts, the workspace configuration takes
precedence.

### Extension settings

Extensions can define settings that users provide during installation, such as
API keys or URLs. These values are stored in a `.env` file within the extension
directory.

To define settings, add a `settings` array to your manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "my-api-extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "settings": [
    {
      "name": "API Key",
      "description": "Your API key for the service.",
      "envVar": "MY_API_KEY",
      "sensitive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

- `name`: The setting's display name.
- `description`: A clear explanation of the setting.
- `envVar`: The environment variable name where the value is stored.
- `sensitive`: If `true`, the value is stored in the system keychain and
  obfuscated in the UI.

To update an extension's settings:

```bash
gemini extensions config <name> [setting] [--scope <scope>]
```

### Custom commands

Provide [custom commands](/docs/cli/custom-commands) by placing TOML files in a
`commands/` subdirectory. Gemini CLI uses the directory structure to determine
the command name.

For an extension named `gcp`:

- `commands/deploy.toml` becomes `/deploy`
- `commands/gcs/sync.toml` becomes `/gcs:sync` (namespaced with a colon)

### Hooks

Intercept and customize CLI behavior using [hooks](/docs/hooks). Define
hooks in a `hooks/hooks.json` file within your extension directory. Note that
hooks are not defined in the `gemini-extension.json` manifest.

### Agent skills

Bundle [agent skills](/docs/cli/skills) to provide specialized workflows. Place
skill definitions in a `skills/` directory. For example,
`skills/security-audit/SKILL.md` exposes a `security-audit` skill.

### Sub-agents

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> Sub-agents are a preview feature currently under active development.

Provide [sub-agents](/docs/core/subagents) that users can delegate tasks to. Add
agent definition files (`.md`) to an `agents/` directory in your extension root.

### <a id="policy-engine"></a>Policy Engine

Extensions can contribute policy rules and safety checkers to Gemini CLI
[Policy Engine](/docs/reference/policy-engine). These rules are defined in
`.toml` files and take effect when the extension is activated.

To add policies, create a `policies/` directory in your extension's root and
place your `.toml` policy files inside it. Gemini CLI automatically loads all
`.toml` files from this directory.

Rules contributed by extensions run in their own tier (tier 2), alongside
workspace-defined policies. This tier has higher priority than the default rules
but lower priority than user or admin policies.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!WARNING]
> For security, Gemini CLI ignores any `allow` decisions or `yolo`
> mode configurations in extension policies. This ensures that an extension
> cannot automatically approve tool calls or bypass security measures without
> your confirmation.

**Example `policies.toml`**

```toml
[[rule]]
mcpName = "my_server"
toolName = "dangerous_tool"
decision = "ask_user"
priority = 100

[[safety_checker]]
mcpName = "my_server"
toolName = "write_data"
priority = 200
[safety_checker.checker]
type = "in-process"
name = "allowed-path"
required_context = ["environment"]
```

### Themes

Extensions can provide custom themes to personalize the CLI UI. Themes are
defined in the `themes` array in `gemini-extension.json`.

**Example**

```json
{
  "name": "my-green-extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "themes": [
    {
      "name": "shades-of-green",
      "type": "custom",
      "background": {
        "primary": "#1a362a"
      },
      "text": {
        "primary": "#a6e3a1",
        "secondary": "#6e8e7a",
        "link": "#89e689"
      },
      "status": {
        "success": "#76c076",
        "warning": "#d9e689",
        "error": "#b34e4e"
      },
      "border": {
        "default": "#4a6c5a"
      },
      "ui": {
        "comment": "#6e8e7a"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Custom themes provided by extensions can be selected using the `/theme` command
or by setting the `ui.theme` property in your `settings.json` file. Note that
when referring to a theme from an extension, the extension name is appended to
the theme name in parentheses, for example,
`shades-of-green (my-green-extension)`.

### Conflict resolution

Extension commands have the lowest precedence. If an extension command name
conflicts with a user or project command, the extension command is prefixed with
the extension name (for example, `/gcp.deploy`) using a dot separator.

## Variables

Gemini CLI supports variable substitution in `gemini-extension.json` and
`hooks/hooks.json`.

| Variable           | Description                                     |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `${extensionPath}` | The absolute path to the extension's directory. |
| `${workspacePath}` | The absolute path to the current workspace.     |
| `${/}`             | The platform-specific path separator.           |
