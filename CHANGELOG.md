# Changelog

Notable changes to this Pi extension playground are listed here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Earlier work is not backfilled; entries start from when this file was added.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Root `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking future playground changes.
- `extensions/session-memory.ts` and `just ext-session-memory`: reinject recent USER/ASSISTANT turns into the system prompt; `/sessionmemory` on|off|status.
- README row for **session-memory**.
- **Auto-load fix:** symlinks under `.pi/extensions/` and `extensions` list in `.pi/settings.json` so Pi discovers this playground without `pi -e` (repo-root `extensions/` alone is not scanned by Pi).

## [2026-03-25]

### Added

- `extensions/extension-picker.ts`: slash commands `/extensions` and `/extentions` to list `pi.extensions` from agent `settings.json` packages (git and npm) plus project `extensions/*.ts`; writes launch hint to `~/.pi/storage/last-extension.json`. Commands `/remember` and `/memory` plus one-time-per-session injection from `~/.pi/storage/agent-memory.md`.
- `just ext-extension-picker` recipe and `just all` entry for the picker stacked with `minimal`.
- README table row for **extension-picker**.
